# RAG-with-pdf-file

## Introduction
Popular LLM models like ChatGPT were trained on a vast general knowledge. Now, there is a growing need for Chatbots that can answer questions based on specific information or knowledge. Here is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) comes to play. RAG combines the power of LLMs like ChatGPT with an external dataset such as an organizational's internal document in order for the model to have access to the most current, reliable facts, and that users have access to the modelâ€™s sources, ensuring that its claims can be checked for accuracy and can be trusted too.

## ABOUT The Project

This project was done using streamlit, Openai API and Langchain, an AI framework for building LLMs application to build a simple conversational Bot. You need an OpenAI API key to be able to use the web app of this project built using streamlit. If you already have your API key, then go ahead and upload your pdf file and start asking questions.
